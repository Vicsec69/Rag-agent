This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent tailored for medical research and healthcare knowledge systems. Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses based solely on pre-trained data, which can lead to hallucinations, outdated information, and lack of source verification—critical issues in the medical domain where accuracy and trust are essential.

The proposed RAG Agent enhances medical question answering by combining LLM-based generation with real-time retrieval from verified medical research papers, clinical documents, and trusted databases. When a user submits a query, the system retrieves relevant medical literature, fuses it with the query, and generates factually grounded, context-aware responses supported by citations.

By integrating vector databases, semantic similarity search, and explainable AI techniques, the RAG Agent ensures that each generated medical insight is traceable, transparent, and evidence-backed. This approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves reliability, making the system suitable for applications such as clinical research assistance, literature review automation, medical education, and decision support systems.

Overall, this RAG-based framework bridges the gap between AI intelligence and medical trustworthiness, enabling safer and more reliable AI-driven medical research support.
